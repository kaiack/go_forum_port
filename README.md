## Running:
- To start run: air
- uses goose for migrations

## My thoughts learning go and making this relatively straightforward backend.
- It was a PITA.
- The language itself is pretty cool, I love how errors are handled. 
- The static typing was pretty good and only helped and never "got in the way" so to speak.
- There are not that many good resources for learning this stuff. Getting started is much harder than other languages.
- There is a big push and mantra that the stdlib does everything you would need, but I don' want to spend time setting up a http server from the level that the stdlib provides.
- I followed some random tutorial on how to structure the app, coming back to it a month or so later, it is not intuitive to me at all. -> **This is my fault entirely, not a language issue. I was just too lazy to trial/error it myself, more popular languages have a general consensus on the structure usually enforced by the server library of choice like flask or express etc.**
- On the flip side, the verbosity of the language makes it quite easy to follow after not visiting it for a while.
- Setting up JWT was kinda confusing after having used them in other languages. Go's jwt was much hard to follow what is going on, but I guess it gives you more minute control over what it does.

## Final thoughts
- I would like to use Go again albeit in a different context.
- I likely won't reach for go again for this use case, but I can see its value for things like microservices or cli tools.
- It's a nifty language.
